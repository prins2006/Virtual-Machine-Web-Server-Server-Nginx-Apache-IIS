## Real-World Example
A company converts an old office building into a server room.

## Simple Example
Renovating an old house instead of building a new one.

## Key Points
- Existing building
- Lower cost

# 3. Redundancy

## Definition
**Redundancy** means keeping backup equipment or systems so that if one component fails, another immediately takes over.

## Purpose
- Prevent downtime.
- Increase reliability.
- Ensure continuous operation.

## Examples of Redundancy
- Dual Power Supply
- Dual UPS
- Multiple Network Switches
- Multiple Internet Connections
- Backup Generator

## Production Example
A server has two power supplies connected to two different UPS systems. If one UPS fails, the server continues running.

## Simple Example
Having two car tires as spares in case one gets punctured.

## Advantages
- High availability.
- Less downtime.
- Better fault tolerance.

## Disadvantages
- Higher cost.
- More maintenance.

## Key Points
- Backup components
- Failure protection
- Business continuity

---

# 4. Reliability

## Definition
**Reliability** is the ability of a system to perform correctly without failure for a long period.

## Purpose
Ensure services run consistently without unexpected failures.

## Example
A server that runs continuously for one year without crashing is highly reliable.

## Real-World Example
Banking servers are designed for very high reliability.

## Factors Affecting Reliability
- Hardware quality
- Software stability
- Proper maintenance
- Environment

## Key Points
- Consistent performance
- Fewer failures
- Long operational life

---

# 5. Availability

## Definition
**Availability** is the percentage of time a system is operational and accessible to users.

## Formula

Availability = (Uptime / Total Time) × 100%

## Common Availability Levels

| Availability | Downtime Per Year |
|--------------|-------------------|
| 99% | About 3.65 days |
| 99.9% | About 8.76 hours |
| 99.99% | About 52 minutes |
| 99.999% | About 5 minutes |

## Example
A website available almost all year has high availability.

## Production Example
Online banking systems target 99.999% availability.

## Key Points
- Measures service accessibility.
- Higher percentage is better.
- Depends on redundancy and maintenance.

---

# 6. Uptime

## Definition
**Uptime** is the total time a system remains running and available without interruption.

## Purpose
Measure how long services stay online.

## Example
A web server running continuously for 100 days has 100 days of uptime.

## Production Example
Cloud providers monitor server uptime continuously.

## Key Points
- System running time.
- Higher uptime means better service quality.

---

# 7. Downtime

## Definition
**Downtime** is the period during which a system is unavailable or not functioning.

## Causes
- Power failure
- Hardware failure
- Network outage
- Software crash
- Maintenance
- Human error

## Effects
- Business interruption
- Revenue loss
- Customer dissatisfaction

## Example
If a website is offline for 2 hours, that period is downtime.

## Key Points
- Opposite of uptime.
- Should be minimized.

---

# 8. PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness)

## Definition
**Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)** measures how efficiently a data center uses power.

## Formula

PUE = Total Facility Energy ÷ IT Equipment Energy

## Interpretation

| PUE | Meaning |
|------|----------|
| 1.0 | Perfect efficiency (ideal) |
| 1.2–1.5 | Excellent |
| 1.5–2.0 | Good |
| Above 2.0 | Poor efficiency |

## Example

Total Facility Power = 1000 kW

IT Equipment Power = 800 kW

PUE = 1000 ÷ 800 = 1.25

This indicates an efficient data center.

## Why PUE Matters
- Reduces energy costs.
- Improves efficiency.
- Lowers environmental impact.

## Key Points
- Measures energy efficiency.
- Lower PUE is better.
- Widely used in modern data centers.

# 9. TGG (The Green Grid)

## Definition
**The Green Grid (TGG)** is a global non-profit organization focused on improving data center energy efficiency and sustainability.

## Purpose
- Develop energy efficiency standards.
- Promote sustainable data center practices.
- Define metrics like PUE.

## Contributions
- PUE
- WUE (Water Usage Effectiveness)
- CUE (Carbon Usage Effectiveness)

## Example
Many organizations use The Green Grid's recommendations to reduce power consumption.

## Key Points
- Industry organization.
- Focus on energy efficiency.
- Creator and promoter of PUE.

# 10. UTI (Uptime Institute)

## Definition
**Uptime Institute (UTI)** is an organization that provides standards, certifications, and best practices for data center reliability and availability.

## Purpose
- Improve data center design.
- Reduce downtime.
- Certify data center infrastructure.

## Main Contribution
The Uptime Institute developed the **Tier Classification System**.

| Tier | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Tier I | Basic Infrastructure |
| Tier II | Redundant Components |
| Tier III | Concurrently Maintainable |
| Tier IV | Fault Tolerant |

## Real-World Example
Large enterprises and cloud providers often design their facilities to meet Tier III or Tier IV standards.

## Key Points
- Defines Tier Standards.
- Focuses on uptime and reliability.
- Internationally recognized.
